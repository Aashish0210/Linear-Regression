# Linear Regression Demo

This repository contains a simple web application that demonstrates linear regression and polynomial regression. It allows users to input a value and see how linear regression is used to predict results. The application also visualizes the regression line to better understand how the model works.

## Features

- **Linear Regression**: Predicts the value based on a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
- **Polynomial Regression**: An extension of linear regression that models the relationship between variables using a polynomial equation.
- **Interactive Graph**: Visualizes the regression line and the data points to help users understand the model's prediction.
- **Responsive Design**: The application adjusts its layout for mobile and tablet devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content of the web page.
- **CSS**: Custom styling to create a dark theme and visually appealing UI.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive layout and some UI components like buttons and forms.
- **Python (Flask)**: The back-end logic for performing linear and polynomial regression calculations (Flask assumed based on the use of `{{ }}` syntax).
